# GLFW Window

We will use GLFW (3.4) for windowing and related events. The library - like all external dependencies - is configured and added to the build tree in `ext/CMakeLists.txt`. `GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN` is defined for all consumers, to enable GLFW's Vulkan related functions (known as **Window System Integration (WSI)**). GLFW 3.4 supports Wayland on Linux, and by default it builds backends for both X11 and Wayland. For this reason it will need the development headers for both platforms (and some other Wayland/CMake dependencies) to configure/build successfully. A particular backend can be requested at runtime if desired via `GLFW_PLATFORM`.

Although it is quite feasible to have multiple windows in a Vulkan-GLFW application, that is out of scope of this guide. So for our purposes GLFW (the library) and a single window are a monolithic unit - initialized and destroyed together. This can be encapsulated in a `std::unique_ptr` with a custom deleter, especially since GLFW returns an opaque pointer (`GLFWwindow*`).

```cpp
// window.hpp
namespace lvk::glfw {
struct Deleter {
	void operator()(GLFWwindow* window) const noexcept;
};

using Window = std::unique_ptr<GLFWwindow, Deleter>;

// Returns a valid Window if successful, else throws.
[[nodiscard]] auto create_window(glm::ivec2 size, char const* title) -> Window;
} // namespace lvk::glfw

// window.cpp
void Deleter::operator()(GLFWwindow* window) const noexcept {
	glfwDestroyWindow(window);
	glfwTerminate();
}
```

GLFW can create fullscreen and borderless windows, but we will stick to a standard window with decorations. Since we cannot do anything useful if we are unable to create a window, all other branches throw a fatal exception (caught in main).

```cpp
auto glfw::create_window(glm::ivec2 const size, char const* title) -> Window {
	static auto const on_error = [](int const code, char const* description) {
		std::println(stderr, "[GLFW] Error {}: {}", code, description);
	};
	glfwSetErrorCallback(on_error);
	if (glfwInit() != GLFW_TRUE) {
		throw std::runtime_error{"Failed to initialize GLFW"};
	}
	// check for Vulkan support.
	if (glfwVulkanSupported() != GLFW_TRUE) {
		throw std::runtime_error{"Vulkan not supported"};
	}
	auto ret = Window{};
	// tell GLFW that we don't want an OpenGL context.
	glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
	ret.reset(glfwCreateWindow(size.x, size.y, title, nullptr, nullptr));
	if (!ret) { throw std::runtime_error{"Failed to create GLFW Window"}; }
	return ret;
}
```

`App` can now store a `glfw::Window` and keep polling it in `run()` until it gets closed by the user. We will not be able to draw anything to the window for a while, but this is the first step in that journey.

Declare it as a private member:

```cpp
 private:
	glfw::Window m_window{};
```

Add some private member functions to encapsulate each operation:

```cpp
	void create_window();

	void main_loop();
```

Implement them and call them in `run()`:

```cpp
void App::run() {
	create_window();

	main_loop();
}

void App::create_window() {
	m_window = glfw::create_window({1280, 720}, "Learn Vulkan");
}

void App::main_loop() {
	while (glfwWindowShouldClose(m_window.get()) == GLFW_FALSE) {
		glfwPollEvents();
	}
}
```

> On Wayland you will not even see a window yet: it is only shown _after_ the application presents a framebuffer to it.
