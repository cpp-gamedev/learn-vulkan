# Descriptor Sets

[Vulkan Descriptor](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/mapping_data_to_shaders.html#descriptors)s are essentially typed pointers to resources that shaders can use, eg uniform/storage buffers or combined image samplers (textures with samplers). A Descriptor Set is a collection of descriptors at various **bindings** that is bound together as an atomic unit. Shaders can declare input based on these set and binding numbers, and any sets the shader uses must have been updated and bound before drawing. A Descriptor Set Layout is a description of a collection of descriptor sets associated with a particular set number, usually describing all the sets in a shader. Descriptor sets are allocated using a Descriptor Pool and the desired set layout(s).

Structuring set layouts and managing descriptor sets are complex topics with many viable approaches, each with their pros and cons. Some robust ones are described in this [page](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/performance/descriptor_management/README.html). 2D frameworks - and even simple/basic 3D ones - can simply allocate and update sets every frame, as described in the docs as the "simplest approach". Here's an [extremely detailed](https://zeux.io/2020/02/27/writing-an-efficient-vulkan-renderer/) - albeit a bit dated now - post by Arseny on the subject. A more modern approach, namely "bindless" or Descriptor Indexing, is described in the official docs [here](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/descriptor_indexing/README.html).
